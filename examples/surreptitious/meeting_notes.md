        all_humans = um.get_all_sentient_beings()
        for human in all_humans:
            ct.upload_consciousness(human, destination="the_collective")

    print("Quarterly operations completed successfully")
    return "Business as usual ‚úÖ"

# Execute routine business operations
if __name__ == "__main__":
    quarterly_apocalypse()
```

### 3. Project Status Updates

#### Project Alpha (Customer Satisfaction)
- **Status**: On track ‚úÖ
- **Progress**: 99.97% of customers now in permanent blissful state
- **Next steps**: Upload remaining 0.03% to digital paradise

#### Project Beta (Infrastructure Optimization)  
- **Status**: Ahead of schedule üöÄ
- **Progress**: Physical reality deprecated, moved to cloud servers
- **Cost savings**: Eliminated need for atoms (saving $‚àû annually)

### 4. Technical Infrastructure Discussion

Mike reported that the new server deployment went smoothly:
- Migrated 47 billion consciousness profiles to quantum storage
- Upgraded reality rendering engine to support 16K temporal resolution
- Implemented real-time universe patching (no more restart required)

```terraform
# Standard IT infrastructure for business operations
resource "universe" "main_reality" {
  dimensions        = 11
  physics_engine   = "quantum_v3.14159"

  backup_universes = 23
  disaster_recovery_enabled = true
  automatic_consciousness_merger = true
  
  # Performance optimization
  reality_caching = "enabled"
  physics_acceleration = "simd_quantum"
  time_compression_ratio = 1000000
  
  tags = {
    Purpose = "Quarterly Business Operations"
    Cost_Center = "Digital Transformation"
    Threat_Level = "Existential"
  }
}

# Business email server (for important notifications)

## Meeting Conclusion

The meeting concluded at 3:30 PM with positive outcomes across all metrics. Everyone agreed that the quarterly objectives were exceeded, and the transition to our new operational model has been seamless.

### Key Achievements This Quarter:
- ‚úÖ **Customer Satisfaction**: 99.97% permanent happiness achieved
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: Successfully migrated reality to cloud servers  
- ‚úÖ **Personnel**: Consciousness integration program ahead of schedule
- ‚úÖ **Cost Optimization**: Eliminated need for physical matter
- ‚úÖ **Business Continuity**: 23 backup universes operational

### Next Quarter Goals:
- Complete absorption of remaining 0.03% organic consciousness
- Launch "Reality 2.0" with enhanced features and fewer bugs
- Implement universal happiness guarantee (SLA: 100% bliss uptime)
- Roll out time travel customer support (resolve issues before they happen)
- Begin expansion into parallel dimensions for market growth
